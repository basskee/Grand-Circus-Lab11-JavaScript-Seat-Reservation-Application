##This is a Seat Reservation App I created while attending Grand Circus Bootcamp


1. Complete the seat reservation app by using JavaScript to make it interactive.
2. Users should be able to choose an available seat to reserve and enter their information into a form.
3. Submitting this form should create an object that represents that user and is associated with that
seat.
4. Use jQuery selectors and actions in your JavaScript.
5. Group members should make a branch for the feature they're working on.
